#Crate::
To create a task press on create to do button. After that write data than hit submit button.
If don't want any data and go to back you can use the back button. I validate all feild so you must write everything without description beacuse the description is a optional feild.

#Edit:
if you want edit your data press on light color edit button it will be take you on edit page. And you can easily change any information.

#Complete and Incomplete:
When you add a new task your status will be incomplete by default and you will see a thumbs down icon on action coulmn. If you complete your task you will press on the thumbs down icon and it will be complete and thumbs down icon will be gone and a thumbs up icon will come in  action column. But if you realize that your task isn't complete you should press on thumbs up icon it will be thumbs down icon and it's mean that your task is not complete.

#delete:
If you want to delete your task you can easily delete your task by press on a trash icon. If you press that icon your task will be delete.
